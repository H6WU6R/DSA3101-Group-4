    "CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY\t0.40\t0.06\tCluster 0 uses cash advances regularly (40% of months) vs. very low frequency in Cluster 1.\n",

    "Cluster-by-Cluster Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0\n",
    "\t•\tHigh BALANCE & High CASH_ADVANCE:\n",
    "They carry a large balance (4,269) and take significant cash advances (3,514 on average). This suggests they often rely on credit/cash advances, potentially incurring higher interest/fees.\n",
    "\t•\tLarge Purchases But Lower Frequency:\n",
    "While total purchases are quite high (1,620), the frequency is only 0.38—meaning they have fewer but bigger transactions, including large one-off purchases (1,051).\n",
    "\t•\tRarely Pay in Full:\n",
    "Their PRC_FULL_PAYMENT is just 0.05, indicating they mostly revolve their balance and rarely clear the statement completely. This could be profitable for the bank (interest income) but also riskier.\n",
    "\t•\tHeavy Users:\n",
    "They make large payments (3,920) but still maintain a high balance, implying they cycle through credit usage and repayment frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Characterization:\n",
    "“High-Spend, High-Credit, Revolver Segment” — They use a lot of credit, frequently take cash advances, and don’t pay the full balance. They might be profitable due to interest/fees but carry higher risk if their financial situation changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Marketing Actions:\n",
    "\t•\tRisk Assessment: Monitor credit risk closely; they might default if circumstances change.\n",
    "\t•\tUpsell Specialized Products: If they’re high-income or stable, offer premium credit lines or personal loans (to consolidate balances).\n",
    "\t•\tEncourage Payment Plans: Since they revolve balances, offering structured installment plans might help them (and reduce bank risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1\n",
    "\t•\tLower BALANCE & Purchases:\n",
    "With a balance around 850 and total purchases at 840, they’re relatively low-volume credit card users compared to Cluster 0.\n",
    "\t•\tHigher Purchase Frequency:\n",
    "Their purchase frequency is 0.52 (vs. 0.38), meaning they use the card more regularly across different months, but likely for smaller amounts.\n",
    "\t•\tMinimal Cash Advances:\n",
    "Both the amount (309) and frequency (0.06) are quite low, suggesting they rarely rely on cash advances.\n",
    "\t•\tHigher PRC_FULL_PAYMENT:\n",
    "At 0.18, they pay off the statement in full nearly 1 out of 5 months, which is significantly higher than Cluster 0, though still not extremely high overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Characterization:\n",
    "“Moderate Spenders, Steadier Payment Habits” — They keep modest balances, make smaller but more frequent purchases, and are more likely to pay off their balance in full from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Marketing Actions:\n",
    "\t•\tReward Programs: Since they purchase frequently (but in smaller amounts) and pay more regularly, a cash-back or points reward system could encourage them to spend more on the card.\n",
    "\t•\tLimit Increase: If they appear lower risk, the bank could consider gradually increasing their credit limit to capture more spend.\n",
    "\t•\tCross-Sell: Offer additional products (like auto loans or mortgages) if they have stable repayment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Interpretation\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 0 is a “high usage, high balance, cash-advance heavy” group with relatively lower full payment rates. They make fewer but larger purchases, rely significantly on credit (including cash advances), and revolve debt more often.\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 1 is a “moderate-spend, higher frequency, lower balance” group who occasionally pay off the card in full and rarely use cash advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Banking Terms:\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 0 might be more profitable in terms of interest and fees but also carry higher credit risk.\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 1 is more conservative in usage, lower risk, but might not generate as much interest revenue—though they have growth potential if incentivized properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion & Next Steps\n",
    "\t1.\tTailored Marketing:\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 0: Possibly offer installment plans or debt consolidation loans. Monitor risk.\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 1: Provide rewards to encourage higher spending, or upsell other banking products.\n",
    "\t2.\tRisk Management:\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 0: Watch credit utilization and delinquency risks.\n",
    "\t•\tCluster 1: Lower risk; might be eligible for credit line increases or premium product offers.\n",
    "\t3.\tFurther Analysis:\n",
    "\t•\tEvaluate if these clusters align with additional data (demographics, income) for even finer targeting.\n",
    "\t•\tConsider if 2 clusters is enough or if you might find more nuanced segments with k=3 or k=4."
