    "The `grid_search_cv` function performs a comprehensive grid search to optimize hyperparameters for a LightFM recommendation model using 5-fold cross-validation. It first extracts and standardizes user features based on a provided feature list, converting them into a sparse matrix, and then constructs an interaction matrix and an identity-based item features matrix. For each combination of hyperparameters (including loss function, number of components, learning rate, epochs, and regularization parameters), the function splits the training data into folds, applies upsampling on minority classes for each product column in the training interactions, and trains a LightFM model on the imputed data. It then evaluates the model on the validation set using both a standard precision@3 metric and a custom top-3 accuracy function, averaging the scores over the folds. All results are recorded and printed, and the function returns the best hyperparameters based on the highest average top-3 accuracy."
