    "The `grid_search_cv` function performs a comprehensive grid search to optimize hyperparameters for a LightFM recommendation model using 5-fold cross-validation. It first extracts and standardizes user features based on a provided feature list, converting them into a sparse matrix, and then constructs an interaction matrix and an identity-based item features matrix. For each combination of hyperparameters (including loss function, number of components, learning rate, epochs, and regularization parameters), the function splits the training data into folds, applies upsampling on minority classes for each product column in the training interactions, and trains a LightFM model on the imputed data. It then evaluates the model on the validation set using both a standard precision@3 metric and a custom top-3 accuracy function, averaging the scores over the folds. All results are recorded and printed, and the function returns the best hyperparameters based on the highest average top-3 accuracy."

    "In the subsequent code snippet, we define three sets of columns: `target_cols` for various spending categories, `feature_cols` for customer and financial attributes used in imputation, and `label_cols` representing the labels for different financial product recommendations. The target variable `Y` is created from the imputed original dataset using the label columns, then binarized by converting values greater than or equal to 2 into 1s, indicating suitability for a particular product. Two user feature sets are prepared: a 'base' set (only using fundamental features) and an 'expanded' set (which includes additional spending categories). These feature sets are stored in a dictionary, and the full dataset is then split into training and testing subsets using a standard 80/20 split, ensuring that the test set remains unmodified for subsequent evaluation of the recommendation model."
