- **Cluster 0 (n = 2077):**  
  Thresholds are relatively low (e.g., ClickThroughRate ≈ 0.086, WebsiteVisits = 7, PagesPerVisit ≈ 2.89, TimeOnSite ≈ 4.70, EmailOpens = 5, EmailClicks = 3). This aligns with the description of high-value customers who, despite having high overall value and loyalty, exhibit low digital engagement. In other words, even moderate engagement is enough for conversion in this group.

- **Cluster 1 (n = 3053):**  
  Thresholds are slightly higher (e.g., ClickThroughRate ≈ 0.160, ConversionRate ≈ 0.061, WebsiteVisits = 11, PagesPerVisit ≈ 3.01, TimeOnSite ≈ 4.22, EmailOpens = 6, EmailClicks = 3), suggesting that low-value customers in this segment require modest levels of digital engagement to convert.

- **Cluster 2 (n = 1264):**  
  This cluster shows significantly higher thresholds across most KPIs (e.g., ClickThroughRate ≈ 0.172, ConversionRate ≈ 0.174, WebsiteVisits = 18, PagesPerVisit ≈ 7.54, TimeOnSite ≈ 14.81, EmailOpens = 14, EmailClicks = 8). This indicates that high-value customers in Cluster 2 demand much higher digital interaction before converting—highlighting a segment that is both selective and engaged.

- **Cluster 3 (n = 753):**  
  No thresholds were computed due to insufficient variation in conversion, suggesting that conversion outcomes are homogeneous within this cluster. This may indicate either nearly universal conversion or non-conversion, requiring further investigation.

- **Cluster 4 (n = 331):**  
  While most KPIs show reasonable thresholds (e.g., ClickThroughRate ≈ 0.038, ConversionRate ≈ 0.034, WebsiteVisits = 9, PagesPerVisit ≈ 3.36, TimeOnSite ≈ 5.38), the thresholds for EmailOpens and EmailClicks are infinite. This likely implies that email engagement metrics do not differentiate between converters and non-converters in this segment—possibly because nearly all observations are above (or below) the effective cutoff.

- **Cluster 5 (n = 522):**  
  Similarly, while most thresholds are in a sensible range (e.g., ClickThroughRate ≈ 0.151, ConversionRate ≈ 0.051, WebsiteVisits = 12, PagesPerVisit ≈ 5.52, TimeOnSite ≈ 3.93), the threshold for EmailOpens is infinite and for EmailClicks it is around 5. This suggests that for low-value customers in Cluster 5, email opens are not a meaningful discriminator, though email clicks remain moderately relevant.

### Overall Takeaways

- **Variability Across Clusters:**  
  The optimal thresholds vary significantly between clusters, reflecting the different levels of digital engagement required for conversion in each segment.

- **High Engagement Requirement in Cluster 2:**  
  The higher thresholds in Cluster 2 indicate that high-value customers here require substantially greater digital engagement before converting.

- **Email Metrics in Clusters 4 & 5:**  
  Infinite thresholds for email opens in some clusters suggest that these metrics may not be effective for distinguishing converters in those segments, potentially due to a very homogeneous behavior in email engagement.

- **Homogeneity in Cluster 3:**  
  The inability to compute thresholds in Cluster 3 indicates a lack of variability in conversion outcomes, warranting further analysis.
