### **Cluster 0 (Most high value customers, high overall engagement and loyalty**

**Description:**  
A customer segment for which the measured KPIs do not show any statistically significant thresholds. This suggests that for these customers, the standard digital engagement metrics do not clearly drive their conversion behavior.

**Insight:**  
Without discriminative digital engagement thresholds, it is likely that external factors—such as offline influences, alternative online behaviors, or even non-digital attributes—are key drivers for conversion in this group.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Collect Additional Data:** Consider integrating demographic, purchase history, or behavioral data beyond standard KPIs to better profile and segment this group.  
- **Test Alternative Channels:** Explore other engagement metrics or channels (e.g., mobile app usage, in-store interactions) that might be more indicative of conversion.  
- **Qualitative Research:** Conduct surveys or interviews to understand what motivates these customers outside of the digital metrics currently tracked.

### **Cluster 1 (Most low value customers, with less ad spend and low digital engagement**

**Description:**  
This cluster comprises customers with generally low email engagement, as reflected by a low median of EmailOpens. The distribution of email opens does not correlate with conversion behavior—both converters and non-converters are spread throughout the range—resulting in an infinite threshold.


**Insight:**  
Although the EmailOpens is generally low, the variability within this metric does not translate into a meaningful differentiator between converters and non-converters. The infinite threshold implies that no specific cutoff value for email opens can be established that reliably predicts conversion outcomes.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Optimise Email Content:** Refine email subject lines and messaging to enhance engagement. Focus on making emails more compelling to potentially increase overall open rates and subsequent interactions.  
- **Integrate Additional Channels:** Since email opens alone are not a strong predictor, consider complementing email strategies with other digital channels (social media, retargeting, or targeted ads) to better capture and convert interest.  
- **Experiment Through A/B Testing:** Conduct tests on various email formats and delivery times to determine if alternative strategies can make email opens a more discriminative metric in driving conversions.

This approach aims to leverage insights from the current data while exploring avenues that might enhance the predictive power of email engagement for Cluster 1.

### **Cluster 2 (High value customers with moderate digital engagement)**

**Description:**  
This segment shows a clear pattern of moderate digital engagement that drives conversion. Their behavior indicates a need for a measured level of interaction before they commit.

**Thresholds:**  
- **WebsiteVisits ≥ 7**  
- **PagesPerVisit ≥ 2.89**  
- **EmailOpens ≥ 9**  
- **EmailClicks ≥ 3**  

**Insight:**  
These customers require a blend of digital interactions—spending time on the site, exploring several pages, and engaging with emails—to convert. Their higher threshold for email opens suggests they are attentive to content and need sufficient touchpoints to make a decision.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Consistent Multi-Touch Campaigns:** Use a combination of well-timed emails and engaging website content to guide them through the conversion funnel.  
- **Content-Rich Experience:** Ensure the website offers rich, useful information that encourages exploration (e.g., product demos, detailed guides).  
- **Personalized Follow-Up:** Use behavioral data to tailor email follow-ups and website recommendations, reinforcing their interest with relevant offers.

### **Cluster 3 (Relatively high income, high digital engagement, previous purchases not very high**

**Description:**  
This group comprises customers with higher digital engagement—evidenced by above-threshold pages per visit and steady email activity—suggesting a more deliberate, research-oriented buying process.

**Thresholds:**  
- **PagesPerVisit ≥ 3.01**  
- **EmailOpens ≥ 6**  
- **EmailClicks ≥ 3**  

**Insight:**  
A higher pages-per-visit metric indicates these customers are exploring multiple facets of the site before converting. Their email behavior further confirms that they are engaged enough to interact with digital content, albeit in a measured way.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Enhance Website Navigation:** Improve the site layout and content to facilitate deeper exploration and make it easier to locate detailed product information.  
- **Educational Email Campaigns:** Develop emails that provide in-depth insights, tips, or case studies to support their research phase and nudge them toward conversion.  
- **Interactive Tools:** Consider adding interactive tools (like product comparison features or quizzes) that engage these customers further.

### **Cluster 4 (Relatively high value customers, higlhy engaged in email but lower social shares**

**Description:**  
This segment is characterised by extended time on site, suggesting that these relatively high-value customers are methodically researching before making a purchase.

**Thresholds:**  
- **TimeOnSite ≥ 14.81**  

**Insight:**  
Spending more than 14 minutes on the site points to a deep-dive approach to decision-making. These customers likely seek comprehensive information or reassurance before converting.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Rich, In-Depth Content:** Develop detailed content such as product demos, FAQs, and comprehensive guides that address common concerns and facilitate informed decisions.  
- **Retargeting Efforts:** Use retargeting strategies to bring these thoughtful visitors back, perhaps offering additional incentives or clarifications.  
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Implement dynamic website elements that suggest related products or additional resources based on their browsing patterns.

### **Cluster 5 (Low value customers, relatively lower income**

**Description:**  
This group appears to include low-value customers where even a high rate of email clicks (indicated as infinite) does not translate into meaningful conversion outcomes.

**Thresholds:**  
- **EmailClicks:** Infinite (non-discriminative)  
- Other KPIs: –  

**Insight:**  
The infinite threshold for email clicks implies that while these customers interact with emails, that behavior is not sufficient to drive conversion—possibly due to price sensitivity or misaligned messaging.

**Actionable Strategy:**  
- **Stronger Incentives:** Adjust the email content to include more compelling offers or limited-time discounts that push for immediate action.  
- **Channel Diversification:** Since email alone isn’t spurring conversions, experiment with other touchpoints such as SMS, social media engagement, or even loyalty programs to capture their interest.  
- **Refine Targeting:** Look deeper into the customer profile to understand their preferences and tailor messaging accordingly, ensuring that emails align more closely with their needs.

## **Overall Business Insights and Recommendations**

1. **Expand Data Collection:**  
   Several clusters (0, 1, and 5) show non-discriminative thresholds for key digital KPIs. Enhancing data collection with additional metrics—such as customer demographics, historical purchase behavior, or offline interactions—can provide a more complete picture of what drives conversion.

2. **Tailor Multi-Channel Strategies:**  
   While some clusters (like 2 and 3) respond well to a combination of website and email engagement, others (Clusters 1 and 5) may require a diversified approach. Implementing multi-channel campaigns can help bridge the gap for segments where a single channel does not clearly drive action.

3. **Optimize Content Based on Engagement Patterns:**  
   For clusters that invest more time on the site (Cluster 4) or explore multiple pages (Clusters 2 and 3), enriching the digital experience with high-quality, interactive, and in-depth content is crucial. This not only supports their research phase but also builds trust.

4. **Revise Email Tactics:**  
   Clusters with non-discriminative email metrics indicate that simply reaching customers via email is not enough. Experiment with different email formats, subject lines, and personalized content to uncover strategies that translate email engagement into conversion.

5. **Investigate Heterogeneous Clusters Further:**  
   For clusters lacking clear digital engagement drivers (especially Cluster 0), further qualitative and quantitative research is necessary to identify hidden motivators. This may involve targeted surveys, focus groups, or analysis of alternative behavioral data.

By aligning engagement strategies with these cluster-specific insights, banks can more effectively target and convert diverse customer segments while optimising digital marketing investments.
